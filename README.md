Brushing up on MVC with various Microsoft tutorials

This tutorial helped with sorting logic:
https://www.itworld.com/article/2956575/development/how-to-sort-search-and-paginate-tables-in-asp-net-mvc-5.html
  
I also found this tutorial really helpful:
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/mvc/overview/getting-started/getting-started-with-ef-using-mvc/sorting-filtering-and-paging-with-the-entity-framework-in-an-asp-net-mvc-application
 
I followed this tutorial for repository pattern and testing: https://msdn.microsoft.com/tr-tr/library/ff847525(v=vs.100).aspx
